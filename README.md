# los-angeles-police-killings-data

The Los Angeles Times' database of people killed by local police in Los Angeles County.

## About the data

Since 2000, there have been nearly 900 killings by local police that were ruled a homicide by county medical examiners. The Times' [Homicide Report](https://homicide.latimes.com/) compiled the deaths by reviewing publicly-available records from the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner's office and verifying information with law enforcement.

The data are published by The Times's in its [police killings database](https://www.latimes.com/projects/los-angeles-police-killings-database/).

The records include each death that has been ruled a homicide by medical examiners, which is the death of a person at the hands of another. Our records do not include deaths that have not been ruled a homicide, such as on-duty vehicular deaths, jail suicides and other in-custody deaths. Some counts, such as those from the local Black Lives Matter chapter, have included such incidents.
